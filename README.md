# AI-PLANT-DETCTION-MODEL
Hello, i am a high school student. just made an attempt to build a CV model. This project is an AI-based model that detects and classifies plants from images. It uses deep learning techniques in computer vision to recognize plant species. The goal is to provide a tool that can support agriculture, education, and biodiversity research.
